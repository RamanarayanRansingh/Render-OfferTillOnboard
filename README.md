![Talent Acquisition Rollercoaster](images/Designer1.png)

## 🎢 Welcome to the Talent Acquisition Rollercoaster!

Hiring can feel like a wild rollercoaster ride. One minute, candidates accept your offer, and the next, they’re ghosting you faster than a disappearing act. But not anymore! With **"Offer Till On Board"**, we’ve transformed this chaotic ride into a smooth and predictable journey, powered by Flask and deployed on Render.

## 🕵️‍♀️ The Vanishing Candidate Dilemma

This project started as a Comviva capstone project and now has been fine-tuned for real-world applications:

> "Candidates say yes to job offers, but disappear before they even show up for the first day!" - Every HR Manager Ever

This problem costs organizations both time and money, and we’re here to solve it by predicting candidate behavior with data!

## 🔮 The Flask-Powered Crystal Ball

We’ve ditched guesswork for good! Our predictive model is like a crystal ball (but powered by Flask and scientific rigor).

### What’s Under the Hood:
- 🧠 A data-driven predictive model.
- 🔍 A tool to identify potential candidate drop-offs.
- 💡 Insights that give hiring teams an upper hand in decision-making.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack for Prediction & Deployment on Render

1. **Flask Framework**: Our lightweight web framework to serve predictions.
2. **Feature Engineering**: Turning raw HR data into meaningful signals.
3. **Predictive Modeling**: Trained models to identify candidates likely to drop off.
4. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Fine-tuning the model for maximum accuracy.
5. **Flask App Deployment on Render**: Seamlessly hosting our predictive engine.
